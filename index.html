    <p>Like a person who has gained mastery over their craft, you must gain mastery over your life, take your life out of neutral, no one can make this commitment for you, intentionally pursue your own God-given purpose and maximize your own divine potential, intentionally get rid of self-defeating habits and undermining relationships. Being different doesn’t imply inferior or superior to others, especially inferior, don’t confuse being different with being lesser, different simply means different. A woman is not less than a man because she is a woman, a man is not more than a woman because he is a man, their differences are necessary because of their purposes. Each man is as low or high, as little or great, as base or noble, as his thoughts, no more, no less, each moves within the sphere of his own thoughts, and that sphere is his world, in that world in which he forms his habits of thoughts, he finds his company. The poor man who is to become rich must begin at the bottom, and must not wish, nor try to appear affluent by attempting something far beyond his means. 
    </p>
    <p>A modest and true beginning in any sphere will better ensure success than an exaggerated advertisement of one’s standing and importance, the smaller the capital, the smaller should be the sphere of operation. Unpractical people burden their minds with useless and unverifiable theories, and court failure by entertaining speculations which, by their very nature, cannot be applied in practice. A successful man is a man whose powers are shown in what he does, and not in the mere talking and arguing, avoids metaphysical quibbling and quandaries, but applies himself to the accomplishment of some good and useful end. That which cannot be reduced to practice should not be allowed to hamper the mind, it should be thrown aside, abandoned and ignored, if theory should be proved to have no useful end, it should still retain as a beautiful theories which are proved to have no use in life, and no substantial basis of reality.</p>

    <p>Every great accomplishment in life is traceable to certain nuggets that make things work. It is the application of these nuggets that determine one’s success in life. Nobody is luckier than the other, it’s the secrets each one is trading with that makes things happen. The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you! Unrestrained behaviour leads eventually to destruction. People who have no vision also have no goal or purpose-nothing to shoot for. They have no direction and nowhere to go in life and, therefore they go nowhere.</p>
    <p>REALITY bites, anytime a reality dawn on me so hard, its bites and wrestles successfully with the elements of nature without or with the enemies of virtue and truth within, have obtained this ripened knowledge experientially in the hardest way, that if we rely upon the light of another, darkness will overtake us, but if we rely upon our own light we have but to keep it burning, we may both draw light from another and communicate it, but to think it sufficient while our own lamp is rusting in neglect, is shortly to find ourselves abandoned in darkness, our own inner light is the light which never fails us.</p>
